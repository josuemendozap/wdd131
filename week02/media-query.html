            <h2>2 Nephi 4:20 - 21</h2>
            <p>20 My God hath been my support; he hath led me through mine afflictions in the wilderness; and he hath
                preserved me upon
                the waters of the great deep.</p>
            <p>21 He hath filled me with his love, even unto the consuming of my flesh.</p>

            <h2>Alma 36:17 - 21</h2>
            <p>17 And it came to pass that as I was thus racked with torment, while I was harrowed up by the memory of
                my many sins,
                behold, I remembered also to have heard my father prophesy unto the people concerning the coming of one
                Jesus Christ, a
                Son of God, to atone for the sins of the world.</p>
            <p>18 Now, as my mind caught hold upon this thought, I cried within my heart: O Jesus, thou Son of God, have
                mercy on me,
                who am in the gall of bitterness, and am encircled about by the everlasting chains of death.</p>
            <p>19 And now, behold, when I thought this, I could remember my pains no more; yea, I was harrowed up by the
                memory of my
                sins no more.</p>
            <p>20 And oh, what joy, and what marvelous light I did behold; yea, my soul was filled with joy as exceeding
                as was my
                pain!</p>
            <p>21 Yea, I say unto you, my son, that there could be nothing so exquisite and so bitter as were my pains.
                Yea, and again
                I say unto you, my son, that on the other hand, there can be nothing so exquisite and sweet as was my
                joy.</p>
